## Description

Menus allow a user to navigate through the site. A menu is an object
which contains one or more menu items. Each menu item points to a
logical page on the site. A menu module is required to place the menu on
the page. One menu can have more than one module. For example, one
module might show only the first level menu items and a second module
might show the level 2 menu items.

The Menus list provides an overview of the menus available on a Joomla
site. This includes the details of each individual menu's number of
items published, unpublished and trashed, and the names of linked
modules.

The process for adding a menu to the site is normally as follows:

1.  Create a new menu (using this screen).
2.  Create one or more new menu items for the menu. Each menu item will
    have a specific menu item type.
3.  Create one or more menu modules to display the menu on the site.
    When you create the modules, you will select which menu items
    (pages) the modules will show on.

## How to Access

- Select **Menus **→** Manage** from the Administrator menu.

## Column Headers

Clicking on the title of a column will sort the table view by the
column. A down arrow next to the column title means ascending order and
an up arrow means descending order. The default sort is by **ID#** in
ascending order.

- **Checkbox**. Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and
  Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only
  work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you
  press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.
- **Title**. The name of the menu.
- **\# Published**. Number of published menu items in this menu.
- **\# Unpublished**. Number of unpublished menu items in this menu.
- **\# Trashed**. Number of trashed menu items in this menu.
- **Linked Modules**. Lists any menu modules associated with the menu.
  The column shows the module's name, access level, and position on
  template.

<!-- -->

- **ID**. This is a unique identification number for this item assigned
  automatically by Joomla. It is used to identify the item internally,
  and you cannot change this number. When creating a new item, this
  field displays "0" until you save the new entry, at which point a new
  ID is assigned to it.

## Toolbar

At the top of the page you will see the toolbar shown in the
[Screenshot](#Screenshot) above. The functions are:

- **New**. Opens the editing screen to create a new menu.

<!-- -->

- **Edit**. Opens the editing screen for the selected menu. If more than
  one menu is selected (where applicable), only the first menu will be
  opened. The editing screen can also be opened by clicking on the Name
  of the menu.

<!-- -->

- **Delete:** Deletes the selected menus. Works with one or multiple
  menus selected. Deleting a menu also deletes all the menu items it
  contains and any associated menu modules. On clicking Delete you will
  be asked to confirm that you want to delete the selected menus.
  Clicking OK button will delete the menus. Click Cancel to abort the
  deletion.

<!-- -->

- **Rebuild.** Reconstructs and refreshes the menu table. Normally, you
  do *not* need to rebuild this table. This function is provided in case
  the data in the table becomes corrupted.

<!-- -->

- **Options.** Opens the Options window where settings such as default
  parameters can be edited. See [Menus
  Configuration](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Components_Menus_Configuration "Special:MyLanguage/Help4.x:Components Menus Configuration").

<!-- -->

- **Help**. Opens this help screen.

## Quick Tips

- It is expedient to give a descriptive title for new menus because,
  later, you will see it in the *Backend Menus* menu. It is a good idea
  to fill in the *Description* field with information about the menu. If
  you enter a short title in the *Module title* field, you can identify
  the menu's module using that title in the Module Manager.
- Though you can create a copy of a selected menu by clicking the *Copy*
  toolbar button, you can make another instance in the Module Manager as
  well.
- When you create a new menu, use only English alphanumeric characters
  without space in the Unique Name field. It is a good idea using only
  a-z, 0-9 and underscore (\_) characters.
- If you don't enter a *Module title*, no module will be created and the
  menu cannot be displayed in the front end. However you can use the
  Module Manager later to create a new mod_mainmenu module, and assign
  it to the menu.
- If you delete an existing menu, do not forget that all the menu items
  of the respective menu will be also deleted.
- The Main Menu has your default menu item, so it **should not be
  deleted**. The default menu item is defines the page that is displayed
  when you visit www.*yoursite*.com, and your site will not function if
  it is deleted. It is usually your Home menu item but it can be set to
  any menu item including a menu item in a hidden menu. If you change
  the default menu item, make sure that you don't delete that menu item
  either! The menu with the default menu item is marked with an asterisk
  (\*) in the *Menus* menu.

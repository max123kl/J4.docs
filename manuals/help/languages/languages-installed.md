## Quick Tips

- Users can use any Language from the list of installed Languages,
  either by having it assigned in the [Users
  list](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Users/en "Help4.x:Users/en") or
  by filling out a [Menu Item list - New/Edit - User Form
  Layout](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Menu_Item:_New_Item/en#User_Form_Layout "Help4.x:Menu Item: New Item/en")
  at the Frontend. This will cause the Joomla! system prompts to be
  generated in this Language just for this User. For example, if a User
  chooses Spanish as their language, then the Search Module will show
  with prompts in Spanish.
- This User's choice is not affected by the Default Language set for the
  Frontend.

<!-- -->

- Changing a User's Language or the Default Language does not affect the
  website's Articles and other content.

<!-- -->

- **Important**: Do not delete the default language files (for example,
  with FTP). This will create errors on both the Frontend and Backend.
- Additional Languages can be added using the [Install Languages
  Screen](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Extensions_Extension_Manager_Languages/en "Help4.x:Extensions Extension Manager Languages/en").
- If desired, you can show the Frontend site in one Language and show
  the Backend administration pages in a different Language. Also,
  individual articles can be configured to use a different language in
  the Advanced Parameter pane when editing the Article.

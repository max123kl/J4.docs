## Description

This screen checks that your database table structure is up to date with
your Joomla programs and lets you try to fix any problems that are
found. In a normal Joomla version update, changes to the database table
structure (also called "schema") are done automatically to keep the
database version synchronized with the Joomla version. If an update is
done manually, or if some part of an automatic update fails, the
database schema might not be updated to match the version of the Joomla
program files. In this case you will see a list of database problems on
the screen. You can normally fix any problems by clicking on the Fix
button.

## How to Access

- Select **System **→** Information Panel **→** Database** from the
  Administrator menu.

## Column Headers

- **Checkbox**. Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and
  Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only
  work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you
  press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.

  dropdown list of available locations.

## Toolbar

At the top of the page you will see the toolbar shown in the
[Screenshot](#Screenshot) above. The functions are:

- **Update Structure**. This program attempts to fix any database table
  structure problems found in the Database check. It runs any database
  schema change scripts (from the folder
  `administrator/components/com_admin/sql/updates`) that were not run
  during the version update. It then re-checks whether or not the
  database is up to date. If it is successful, the message "Database
  table structure is up to date" will show.

<!-- -->

- **Options.** Opens the Options window where settings such as default
  parameters can be edited.

<!-- -->

- **Help**. Opens this help screen.

## Quick Tips

- If you experience problems during an update, use this Database check
  to see if your database got updated correctly.
- It is strongly recommended that you use the [Joomla
  Update](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Joomla_Update/en "Special:MyLanguage/Help4.x:Joomla Update/en")
  component to update your site. This way the database changes will be
  done automatically.

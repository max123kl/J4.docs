## Description

This component is used for redirecting URLs for web pages that no longer
exist on your website to web pages that are working. The URL you want to
redirect from must not be a working one on your website which actually
loads a web page. It can be the URL to a web page which you have
disabled. The *Expired URL* you specify when you create the redirect
should be the full URL as you would type it in your web browser. The
component will only display the last portion of the source URL in the
redirect listing. The *New URL* you specify when you create a redirect
must be the full URL as well. You must have the *Use URL Rewriting*
option enabled in your Joomla! installation *Global Configuration*
options in order for the redirects you create to function.

## How to access

- Select **System **→** Manage panel **→** Redirects** from the
  Administrator menu.

## Column Headers

Click on the column heading to sort the list by that column's value.

- **Checkbox**. Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and
  Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only
  work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you
  press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.

  - *Published*: The item is published. This is the only state that will
    allow regular website users to view this item.

  ID is assigned to it.

## Quick Tips

- In order for your redirects to work, you must enable the option **Use
  URL Rewriting** in the **Global Configuration** options of your
  Joomla! installation. Note also that just enabling the 'Use URL
  Rewriting' option is not enough. You must take the additional step of
  renaming the *htaccess.txt* file in the web site directory where you
  installed Joomla! to *.htaccess* or to whatever file name your Apache
  web server requires for additional configuration directives. In the
  Apache configuration file this setting is named 'AccessFileName' and
  by default this is set to '.htaccess'.

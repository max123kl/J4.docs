    where you want the links to be indexed but you don't want this page
    to show in search engines.
  - index, nofollow: Index this page, but do not follow any links on the
    page. For example, you might want to do this for an events calendar,

### System

[Complete
screenshot.](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Site_Global_Configuration_System/en "Help4.x:Site Global Configuration System/en")

#### Debug

- **Debug System**. If enabled, diagnostic information, language
  translation, and SQL errors (if present) will be displayed. The
  information will be displayed at the foot of every page you view
  within the Joomla Backend and Frontend. It is not advisable to leave
  the debug mode activated when running a live website.
- **Debug Language**. Select if the debugging indicators \*\*...\*\*
  or ??...?? for the Joomla Language files will be displayed. Debug
  Language will work without Debug System being activated, but you will
  not get the additional detailed references that will help you correct
  any errors.
  - **Language Display**. Select if you should display the language
    constant or the language value when debugging the language strings.

#### Cache

- **System Cache**. Enable caching and set caching level. [Learn
  more.](https://docs.joomla.org/Cache/en "Cache/en")
  - Conservative level: smaller system cache.
  - Progressive level: faster, bigger system cache, includes module
    renderers cache. Not appropriate for extremely large sites.
  - **Cache Handler**.
    - File: Native caching mechanism is file-based. Please make sure the
      cache folders are writable.
  - **Platform Specific Caching**. Enable when HTML output on mobile
    differs from other devices.
  - **Cache Time (minutes)**. The maximum length of time in minutes for
    a cache file to be stored before it is refreshed.
  - **Path to Cache Folder**. Specify a writable folder to store cache
    files if you do not wish to use the default folder.

#### Session

- **Session Handler**. The mechanism by which Joomla identifies a User
  once they are connected to the website using non-persistent cookies.
  - Database: The database session handler is the default handler
    because it is the only one that Joomla can fully configure and
    control on its own.
  - Filesystem: The filesystem handler will be slightly more performant
    than the database handler, but it requires PHP to be configured
    properly otherwise it will crash and Joomla will be totally
    unusable.
    - **Session Save Path**. Enter a full filesystem path. Ensure the
      path has appropriate permissions for PHP to read and write files,
      and if 'session garbage collection' is enabled to delete files
      from it.If this path is not set, Joomla will rely on the PHP
      session.save_path INI configuration or fallback to the system
      temporary directory (as defined by the sys_get_temp_dir() PHP
      function).If neither of those paths are configured or the
      permissions are wrong then it's game over. To recover, edit the
      configuration.php file and set \$session_handler = 'database'.
  - Other handlers (APCu, Memcached, Redis, and WinCache) all rely on
    optional PHP extensions and may be available if your system supports
    them. APCu or WinCache may be no better than the "plain" filesystem
    option. The Memcached and Redis handlers are overkill for Joomla in
    a typical shared hosting environment. Those types of handlers
    succeed if you are deploying Joomla in a load balanced environment
    where multiple servers are involved and you need the session data
    for the application to be available across all servers.
- **Session Lifetime (minutes)**. Auto log out a User after they have
  been inactive for the entered number of minutes. Do not set too high.
- **Shared Sessions**. When enabled, a user's session is shared between
  the Frontend and Backend sections of the site. Note that changing this
  value will invalidate all existing sessions on the site.This is not
  available when the [Force HTTPS](#forcehttps) option is set to
  'Administrator Only'.
- **Track Session Metadata**.
  - Yes: Additional metadata about a user's session (including their
    username, user ID, and which application they are logged into) will
    be logged to the session database table.
  - No: Features dependent on this data will be unavailable.

### Server

[Complete
screenshot.](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Site_Global_Configuration_Server/en "Help4.x:Site Global Configuration Server/en")

#### Server

- **Path to Temp Folder**. Please specify a writable folder to store
  temporary files.
- **Gzip Page Compression**.
  - Yes: Automatically compress the generated HTML pages with Gzip,
    making them smaller and increasing your site's speed score.
  - No: If your server is already doing that for you or if it conflicts
    with third party extensions.
- **Error Reporting**. This parameter sets the level of error reporting
  to be used by PHP on the Joomla site.
  - System Default: Leaves the level of error reporting to that set up
    in the server.
  - None: Switches off error reporting.
  - Simple: Override the server setting to give a basic level of
    reporting.
  - Maximum: Override the server setting to reporting of all
    errors.Should your Joomla site fail to the extent that it is not
    possible to use the administrator page to activate error reporting,
    you can switch on full error reporting by editing the
    'configuration.php' file. Changing the '\$error_reporting' parameter
    in that file to a value of 'maximum' is the equivalent to setting
    Error Reporting to 'Maximum'.
- **Force HTTPS**. Force site access in the selected areas to occur only
  with HTTPS (encrypted HTTP connections with the https:// protocol
  prefix) and also force the use of secure cookies. Note, you must have
  HTTPS enabled on your server to utilise this option.

#### Location

- **Website Time Zone**. Choose a city in the list to configure the date
  and time for display.

#### Web Services

- **Enable CORS**. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
  (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS"
  class="external text" target="_blank"
  rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CORS</a>) enables scripts running
  in a browser to interact with resources from a different origin.
  - **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**. Specifies the origin allowed to
    access Web services on this site, sent back in response to a
    preflight request. Default: \* (=all).
  - **Access-Control-Allow-Headers**. Specifies the header(s) sent back
    in response to a preflight request. Default:
    Content-Type,X-Joomla-Token.
  - **Access-Control-Allow-Methods**. Specifies the Web service
    method(s) allowed to access on this site, sent back in response to a
    preflight request. Default: all methods available for the requested
    route.

#### Proxy

- **Behind Load Balancer**. If your site is behind a load balancer or
  reverse proxy, enable this setting so that IP addresses and other
  configurations within Joomla automatically take this into account.
- **Enable Outbound Proxy**. Some hosts do not allow any network access
  from your site to the outside world by default and require you to
  manually configure an outbound proxy.
  - **Outbound Proxy Host**. Host (domain) name or IP address.
  - **Outbound Proxy Port**.
  - **Outbound Proxy Username**. Leave blank if your outbound proxy does
    not require authentication.

[Complete
screenshot.](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Site_Global_Configuration_Logging/en "Help4.x:Site Global Configuration Logging/en")

#### Logging

- **Path to Log Folder**. Joomla can optionally keep a log file of its
  own and third party extensions' operations. Provide the absolute path
  to a folder that is writeable by PHP; if it's missing or is not
  writeable Joomla will not load at all. For security reasons you must
  not use a folder with systemâ€“wide access such as '/tmp'.
- **Log Almost Everything**. Logs everything, except deprecated APIs.
- **Log Deprecated API**. Logs deprecated APIs.

#### Custom logging

- **Log Priorities**. Can be used to manage custom logging. Select the
  events you want to see in the log file. Default is 'All'. The item(s)
  can be selected/deselected by clicking the dropdown list.
- **Log Categories**. A comma separated list of log categories to
  include or exclude. Common log categories include but are not limited
  to: 'database', 'databasequery', 'database-error', 'deprecated' and
  'jerror'. If empty, custom logging is disabled.

  above.

### Text Filters

[Complete
screenshot.](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Site_Global_Configuration_Text_Filters/en "Help4.x:Site Global Configuration Text Filters/en")

These text filter settings will be applied to all text editor fields
submitted by users in the selected groups.

These filtering options give more control over the HTML your content
providers submit. You can be as strict or as liberal as you require to
suit your site's needs. The filtering is opt-in and the default settings
provide good protection against markup commonly associated with website
attacks.

### Permissions

- Note that **Denied** will overrule any inherited setting and also the
  setting in any child group, component or content. In the case of a
  setting conflict, **Deny** will take precedence.
- **Not Set** is equivalent to **Denied** but can be changed in child
  groups, components and content.

## Toolbar

At the top of the page you will see the toolbar shown in the
[Screenshot](#screenshot) above.

- **Save**. Saves the global configuration options and stays in the
  current screen.

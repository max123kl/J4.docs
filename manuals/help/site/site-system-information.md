## Description

This page provides information about your host server environment,
including operating system, database and PHP settings, and directory
information. There are five different tab panels: System Information,
PHP Settings, Configuration File, Folder Permissions, and PHP
Information. Each screen provides detailed information about that aspect
of your Joomla! website. This information is very helpful when you are
troubleshooting setup problems.

- Note that none of these settings can be changed from these screens.
  This must be done in different locations throughout your Joomla!
  installation, depending on the specific setting.
- Many settings in the Configuration File screen can be changed from the
  [Global
  Configuration](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Site_Global_Configuration/en "Help4.x:Site Global Configuration/en")
  screen. Some settings shown here depend on your host server
  configuration and cannot be changed from inside Joomla!.

## How to access

- Select **System **→** Information Panel **→** System Information**
  from the Administrator menu.

This screen shows the contents of the current Joomla!
*configuration.php* file which is stored under the main **\<path to
joomla\>/joomla_root/** directory. This file is created for you
automatically when you first install Joomla! and where most changes of
the Global Configuration section of Joomla! are recorded. Please note
that none of the settings can be changed from this page. Use [Global
Configuration](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Site_Global_Configuration/en "Help4.x:Site Global Configuration/en")
to see more information about these settings and to make changes.

alt="Help-4x-system-folder-permissions-en.png" />

This screen shows a list of the directories that the webserver should
have write access to. Please note that all directories listed on this
page should say **Writable**. If not, you may need to change the
permissions to be able to install and use Joomla! successfully.

### PHP Information Tab

<img

decoding="async" data-file-width="600" data-file-height="324"
width="600" height="324" alt="Help-4x-system-php-information-en.png" />

This screen displays the full configuration of the PHP server side
scripting language that Joomla! runs on, together with all the
associated system information that goes towards the creation of the web
server. It is the output of an integrated php.info script built into
Joomla!.

PHP is installed, and runs on the server (hence the server side above),
and therefore all the settings are made on the server. The visitor to
the web site does not need to have anything special running on their
local machine in order to view or use any of the extra functionality
that PHP gives to the web site.

All the settings that are ever likely to be needed are displayed here.
Any changes that are required would be made within the *php.ini* and
other configuration files on the web server.

How much control a web site owner has over this information depends on
whether they own the server or if the server host is flexible in their
customer approach.

It is a good practice to know the limitations of a particular server
installation. This screens output is used to find detailed information
about how PHP is implemented on the server.

## Toolbar

At the top of the page you will see the toolbar shown in the
[Screenshot](#Screenshot) above. The functions are:

- **Download as text.** Downloads the System Information in a text file.
- **Download as JSON.** Downloads the System Information in a JSON file.

<!-- -->

- **Help**. Opens this help screen.

## Quick Tips

- If you are having problems installing extensions, uploading files, or
  changing configuration options, check the Directory Permissions screen
  to make sure you have permission to write to files on your web server.
  The "Status" of the directories should be "Writable". If not, you may
  be unable to upload or edit files in these directories.
- When you are seeking help with setup problems, for example in a
  Joomla! web forum, it is very helpful to post specific information
  about your Joomla! installation. This screen is an easy way to find
  all of this information in one place.

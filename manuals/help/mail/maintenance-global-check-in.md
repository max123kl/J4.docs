## Description

Allows Administrators to perform a global check-in of all currently
pending or locked items. It then shows the results of the Global
Check-in. This is useful, for example, if an Article is locked by a User
who opened it for editing and never finished the editing session. In
this case, other Users are not able to edit this Article. Performing a
Global Check-in releases all such items.

## How to access

- Select **System **→** Maintenance Panel **→** Global Check-in** from
  the Administrator menu.

- **Checkbox**. Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and
  Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only
  work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you
  press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.

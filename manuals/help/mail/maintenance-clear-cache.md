## Description

Clears cache files from the cache folders if enabled under the [Site
Global
Configuration](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Site_Global_Configuration/en#Cache_Settings "Help4.x:Site Global Configuration/en")
settings.

Cache files are temporary files that are created to improve the
performance of your site. If you have made significant changes to your
web site, such as changing your Template or Language, your cache files
may be out of date. To avoid any problems caused by out of date cache
files, you can delete all of the cache files. After deletion of *all*
Cache files the website may be a little slower until the cache files are
re-created with use.

## How to Access

- Select **System **→** Maintenance Panel **→** Clear Cache** from the
  Administrator menu.

## Description

The Publishing Workflow component is used to replace static states
(unpublished, published, trashed and archived) with a more generic
approach. This way you can easily create a customized workflow to manage
your articles within a component.

For more information see the [Workflow
Tutorial](https://docs.joomla.org/J4.x:Workflow/en "J4.x:Workflow/en").

## How To Access

- Enable Workflows in
  **Content **→** Articles **→** Options **→** Integration Tab** from
  the Administrator menu. Then...
  - Select **Content **→** Workflows** in the Administrator menu. Then
    ...
    - Select the numbered button in the **Transitions** columns.

## Column Headings

Click on the column heading to sort the list by that column's value.

- **Checkbox**. Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and
  Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only
  work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you
  press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.

<!-- -->

- **Ordering.** You can change the order of an item within a list as
  follows:
  - If the list Filter Options include a Position filter select the
    desired Position. This will limit the list to items that are
    assigned to that Position.
  - Select the Ordering icon <img

    decoding="async" data-file-width="12" data-file-height="23" width="12"
    height="23" alt="Help30-Ordering-colheader-icon.png" /> in the Table
    heading to make it the active ordering item. The ordering icons in
    each row will change from light grey to dark grey and the pointer
    will change to a drag arrow on hover.
  - Select one of the Ordering icons <img
    src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/8/87/Help30-Ordering-colheader-grab-bar-icon.png"
    decoding="async" data-file-width="10" data-file-height="21" width="10"
    height="21" alt="Help30-Ordering-colheader-grab-bar-icon.png" /> and
    drag it up or down to change the position of that row in the list.
    The items will display in the new order within the Position.

<!-- -->

- **Status**. The published status of the item.

<!-- -->

- **Name:** The (full) name of the user.
- **Current Stage.** Default is All.
- **Target Stage.** Default is Basic Stage.

<!-- -->

- **ID**. This is a unique identification number for this item assigned
  automatically by Joomla. It is used to identify the item internally,
  and you cannot change this number. When creating a new item, this
  field displays "0" until you save the new entry, at which point a new
  ID is assigned to it.

## List Filters

**Search bar.** This is a common feature of most Lists. The layout is as
shown below.

<img

decoding="async" data-file-width="1478" data-file-height="76"
width="1478" height="76" alt="Help-4x-colheader-filter-field-en.png" />

- **Search by Text.** Enter part of the search term and click the Search
  icon. The search may be of one or more fields. *Hover* to see a
  *Tooltip* indicating which fields will be searched. In some cases a
  different format is required. For Example, to **Search by ID** enter
  "id:xx", where "xx" is the item ID number (for example, "id:9").
- **Filter Options.** Click to display or hide the additional filters.
- **Clear.** Click to clear the Filter field and restore the list to its
  unfiltered state.
- **Ordering.** Shows the current table ordering field. Select from the
  drop down list to change the order or click a column heading. Ordering
  may be in ascending or descending order. The column heading toggles
  between ascending and descending order.
- **Number to Display.** Shows the number of items in a list. The
  default for a site is 20 but this may be changed in the global
  configuration. Select from the drop-down list to change the number
  displayed. If you select too many complex items they will be slow to
  deliver and display.

**Filter Options**

- **Filter by Status.**
- **Filter by Current Stage.**
- **Filter by Target Stage.**

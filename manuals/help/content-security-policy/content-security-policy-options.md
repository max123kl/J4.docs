## Form Fields

### Content-Security-Policy (CSP)

These options control the Content-Security-Policy.

- **Content Security Policy (CSP).** (Enabled/Disabled) Whether to
  Enable or Disable the Content-Security-Policy.
- **Mode.** (Custome/Detect/Automatic) Configures the mode the plugin
  generates the Content-Security-Policy on. The Custom mode allows
  manual configuration. The Detect mode enables the report collection
  and the automatic mode uses the collected reports to generate the
  Content-Security-Policy.
- **Report-Only.** (Enabled/Disabled) Use the header
  'Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only' instead of
  'Content-Security-Policy'.
- **Nonce.** (Enabled/Disabled) Enable the whitelist for specific inline
  scripts using a cryptographic nonce (number used once) for all scripts
  and styles using the Joomla API. Specifying a nonce makes a modern
  browser ignore 'unsafe-inline' which should still be set for older
  browsers without nonce support.
- **Script hashes.** (Enabled/Disabled) Enable the optional hash based
  whitelist inline scripts using a cryptographic hash for all scripts
  using the Joomla API. Specifying hashes makes a modern browser ignore
  'unsafe-inline' which should still be set for older browsers without
  hash support.
- **Style hashes.** (Enabled/Disabled) Enable the optional hash based
  whitelist inline styles using a cryptographic hash for all styles
  using the Joomla API. Specifying hashes makes a modern browser ignore
  'unsafe-inline' which should still be set for older browsers without
  hash support.
- **frame-ancestors 'self'.** (Enabled/Disabled)Enable the CSP
  clickjacking protection frame-ancestors and only allow the origin
  'self'. Please use the form below to allow origins other than 'self'.
- **Add Directive.** (Subform) You can use this subform to add as many
  entries as you want for the Content-Security-Policy by setting the
  **Policy Directive**, **Value** and **Client**.

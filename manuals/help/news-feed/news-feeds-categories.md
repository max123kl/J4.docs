## Column Headers

Click on the column heading to sort the list by that column's value.

- **Checkbox**. Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and
  Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only
  work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you
  press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.

<!-- -->

- **Ordering.** You can change the order of an item within a list as
  follows:
  - If the list Filter Options include a Position filter select the
    desired Position. This will limit the list to items that are
    assigned to that Position.
  - Select the Ordering icon <img

    decoding="async" data-file-width="12" data-file-height="23" width="12"
    height="23" alt="Help30-Ordering-colheader-icon.png" /> in the Table
    heading to make it the active ordering item. The ordering icons in
    each row will change from light grey to dark grey and the pointer
    will change to a drag arrow on hover.
  - Select one of the Ordering icons <img

    decoding="async" data-file-width="10" data-file-height="21" width="10"
    height="21" alt="Help30-Ordering-colheader-grab-bar-icon.png" /> and
    drag it up or down to change the position of that row in the list.
    The items will display in the new order within the Position.

<!-- -->

- **Title**. The name or title of the feed. Make it as descriptive as
  possible.

  field displays "0" until you save the new entry, at which point a new
  ID is assigned to it.

## List Filters

**Search bar**. Near the top of the page you will see the search bar
shown in the [Screenshot](#screenshot) above.

- **Search by Text**. Enter part of the search term and click the Search

  (for example, "id:19").

  unfiltered state.

  the order:

    descending order.
  - Click a column heading. The column heading toggles between ascending
    and descending order.
- **Number to Display**. Shows the number of items in a list. Select
  from the dropdown list to change the number displayed.The default for
  a site is '20' but this may be changed in the [Global
  Configuration](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Site_Global_Configuration/en#defaultlistlimit "Special:MyLanguage/Help4.x:Site Global Configuration/en").

**Filter Options**

- **Select Status.** Use the drop-down list box to select the published
  state: Published, Unpublished, Trashed, or All. For Articles, you may
  also select Archived. **Important:** With the default setting of
  -Select Status-, the screen only shows Published and Unpublished
  items. If you have the filter set to -Select Status- and you change
  items to Trashed, the Trashed items will disappear from the screen.
  However, they have not been permanently deleted. To do that you need

    toolbar.
2.  Select the items you want to permanently delete.

You can see all items, regardless of their published state, by selecting
All for this filter. You can also re-publish Trashed items by selecting
them and clicking on the Publish icon in the toolbar.

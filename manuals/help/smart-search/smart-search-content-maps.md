## Description

This screen shows the content maps currently in the Smart Search index.
Content maps allow you to cross-reference your indexed content
(articles, etc) to related meta information such as the category in
which it resides. Each content item that is indexed by Smart Search is
added to one or more content maps that can be used as filters when
searching the index.

Content maps are split into two parts:

- Map Group: These are super-containers for a particular type of
  information. For example, a Map Group could be "Type", "Category",
  "Event", "Language" or "Author".
- Content Map: Content maps are the actual values for the meta
  information in a particular Map Group. The Content Maps are, for
  example, the names of the categories or authors.

These Map Groups and Content Maps are what make up the advanced search
panel available on the front-end. For each Map Group there can be a
drop-down select list and the Content Maps are added as values to the
respective list. More advanced site builders can override the default
layouts and use multi-select lists or checkboxes instead.

It's important to note that Map Groups and Content Maps from different
content types are merged into the one list. A Joomla article in a
category called "News" and a news feed or contact in a category named
the same are mapped to the same Content Map in the same Map Group. This
is a little like tagging different types of content with the same label.
The effect is that your site visitor does not have to know how your
content is classified in order to set the correct filters to find it.

The content maps screen shows all the Map Groups within the Smart Search
index together with a number indicating the number of Content Maps
within that Map Group and the items within a Contrent Map. Clicking on a
Map Groups number allows you to see the Content Map within that Map
Group together with the number of content items that belong to that
Content Map. A content item can belong to multiple Content Maps within a
Map Group as well as to multiple Map Groups.

will see different columns. Here you can read what they mean and what is
displayed in each column.

  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and
  Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only
  work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you
  press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.

- **Status**. The status of the content item within Smart Search.
  Published items are shown with a green tick; unpublished items by a

  icon. Changing the status on this screen only affects whether the
  content item is available in search results and does not affect the
  content item itself.

- **Maps**. The number of maps inside the Map Group. Selecting the
  number wil show the maps inside the Map Group.

  items inside the Map Group.

  items in the Map Group. Selecting the number will show the unpublished
  content items inside the Map Group.

  Map Groups or Content Maps.

  with dashes instead of spaces. [Learn
  more.](https://docs.joomla.org/Alias/en "Special:MyLanguage/Alias/en")

### Details Tab

**Left panel**

- **Description**. The description for the item. Category, Subcategory
  and Web Link descriptions may be shown on web pages, depending on the
  parameter settings. These descriptions are entered using the same
  editor that is used for Articles.

- **Parent**. The item (category, menu item, and so on) that is the
  parent of the item being edited.

  - *Trashed:* Item is deleted from the site but still in the database.
    It can be permanently deleted from the database with the Empty Trash

  the multi-language feature of Joomla, keep the default of 'All'.

### Publishing

The grayed out fields are for information only and may not be edited.

- **Created Date.** Date the item(Article, Category, Weblink, etc.) was
  created.
- **Created by.** Optional, choose from a popup window of users. Select
  User by clicking on the user's name. Defaults to user creating new
  category if left blank.
- **Modified Date.** *(Informative only)* Date of last modification.
- **Modified By.** *(Informative only)* Username who performed the last
  modification.
- **Hits.** Number of hits on a Category view.
- **ID.** The unique ID number automatically assigned to this item by
  Joomla!. This number cannot be changed.
- **Meta Description.** An optional paragraph to be used as the
  description of the page in the HTML output. This will generally
  display in the results of search engines. If entered, this creates an
  HTML meta element with a name attribute of "description" and a content
  attribute equal to the entered text.
- **Meta Keywords.** Optional entry for keywords. Must be entered
  separated by commas (for example, "cats, dogs, pets") and may be
  entered in upper or lower case. (For example, "CATS" will match "cats"
  or "Cats"). Keywords can be used in several ways:
  - To help Search Engines and other systems classify the content of the
    Article.
  - In combination with Banner tags, to display specific Banners based
    on the Article content. For example, say you have one Banner with an
    ad for dog products and another Banner for cat products. You can
    have your dog Banner display when a User is viewing a dog-related
    Article and your cat Banner display for a cat-related Article. To do
    this, you would:
    - Add the keywords 'dog' and 'cat' to the appropriate Articles.
    - Add the Tags 'dog' and 'cat' to the appropriate Banners in the
      [Banner Manager
      New/Edit](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Banners:_Edit/en "Help4.x:Banners: Edit/en")
      screen.
    - Set the Banner module Parameter 'Search By Tags' to 'Yes in the
      [Banner Module
      Edit](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Site_Modules:_Banners/en "Help4.x:Site Modules: Banners/en")
      screen.
  - For articles only, in combination with the [Related
    Articles](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Site_Modules:_Articles_-_Related/en "Help4.x:Site Modules: Articles - Related/en")
    module, to display Articles that share at least one keyword in
    common. For example, if the current Article displayed has the
    keywords "cats, dogs, monkeys", any other Articles with at least one
    of these keywords will show in the Related Articles module.
- **Author.** Optional entry for an Author name within the metadata. If
  entered, this creates an HTML meta element with the name attribute of
  "author" and the content attribute as entered here.
- **Robots.** The instructions for web "robots" that browse to this
  page.
  - *Use Global*: Use the value set in the Componentâ†’Options for this
    component.
  - *Index, Follow*: Index this page and follow the links on this page.
  - *No index, Follow*: Do not index this page, but still follow the
    links on the page. For example, you might do this for a site map
    page where you want the links to be indexed but you don't want this
    page to show in search engines.
  - *Index, No follow*: Index this page, but do not follow any links on
    the page. For example, you might want to do this for an events
    calendar, where you want the page to show in search engines but you
    do not want to index each event.
  - *No index, no follow*: Do not index this page or follow any links on
    the page.

from other Categories, such as for Articles, Contacts, News Feeds, and

## Column Headers

Click on the column heading to sort the list by that column's value.

- **Checkbox**. Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and
  Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only
  work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you
  press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.

<!-- -->

- **Ordering.** You can change the order of an item within a list as
  follows:
  - If the list Filter Options include a Position filter select the
    desired Position. This will limit the list to items that are
    assigned to that Position.
  - Select the Ordering icon <img

    decoding="async" data-file-width="12" data-file-height="23" width="12"
    height="23" alt="Help30-Ordering-colheader-icon.png" /> in the Table
    heading to make it the active ordering item. The ordering icons in
    each row will change from light grey to dark grey and the pointer
    will change to a drag arrow on hover.
  - Select one of the Ordering icons <img

    decoding="async" data-file-width="10" data-file-height="21" width="10"
    height="21" alt="Help30-Ordering-colheader-grab-bar-icon.png" /> and
    drag it up or down to change the position of that row in the list.
    The items will display in the new order within the Position.

- **Status**. The published status of the item.

<!-- -->

- **Title**. The name of the item. For a Menu Item, the Title will

- **ID**. This is a unique identification number for this item assigned
  automatically by Joomla. It is used to identify the item internally,
  and you cannot change this number. When creating a new item, this

  ID is assigned to it.

  - Click a column heading. The column heading toggles between ascending
    and descending order.

## Batch Process

The Batch Process allows a change in settings for a group of selected
items marked with a check-mark in the corresponding check-mark boxes. To
use: click on the link found below the table of items being viewed to
activate the drop down field area. Using the 'Batch' Toolbar button will
open a pop up window as shown below.

<img
src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/b/bf/Help-4x-colheader-batch-process-categories-en.png"
decoding="async" data-file-width="600" data-file-height="364"
width="600" height="364"
alt="Help-4x-colheader-batch-process-categories-en.png" />

You can change one value or all three values at one time.

***Note** - if you copy items to a new category, changes you have
selected from access level and language will be applied to the copies,
not the original.*

**How to Batch Process** a group of items:

- Select one or more items on the list by checking the desired category
  check boxes.
- Click the 'Batch' Toolbar button.
- Set one or more of the following values:
  - To change the **Access Levels**, select the desired new access level
    from the Set Access Level list box.
  - To change the **Language**, select the desired language from the Set
    Language list box.
  - To change the **Category**, select a category. To leave the category
    unchanged, use the default value of "Select".
    - To copy the items to a different category, select the desired
      category from the category list box and check the Copy option. In
      this case, the original items are unchanged and the copies are
      assigned to the new category and, if selected, the new access
      level and language.
    - To move the items to a different category, select the desired
      category from the category list box and check the Move option. In
      this case, the original items will be moved to a new category and,
      if selected, be assigned the new access level and language.
- When all of the settings are entered, click on Process to perform the
  changes. A message **"Batch process completed successfully."** will
  show.

Note that nothing will happen if you (a) don't have any items selected
or (b) have not selected an access level, language, or category. If you
wish to clear your entered selections, click on the Cancel button. This
will return all of the Batch controls to their default values. Note that
this does *not* uncheck the check boxes for the items.

## Quick Tips

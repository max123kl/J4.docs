## Form Fields

- **Name.** The name of the Banner. This is the name that will display
  in the *Name* column of the [Banner
  Manager](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Banners/en "Help4.x:Banners/en").

### Details Tab

- **Type**. The type of banner to display. Options are an image file or
  custom HTML code.
  - **Image**. Image file to display for the banner. Click the *Select*
    button to browse and select the image file to use. Use the
    [Media](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Media/en "Help4.x:Media/en")
    page to upload Banner image files to your site. Images for Banners
    have to be in the https://docs.joomla.org/images/banners/ directory.
    - **Width**. The fixed width to resize the banner image to. Leave
      this blank if you want to use the actual width of the banner image
      file.
    - **Height**. The fixed height to resize the banner image to. Leave
      this blank if you want to use the actual height of the banner
      image file.
    - **Alternative Text**. Text to display in place of the banner image
      in the event the image cannot be displayed.
    - **Alternative Text**. Alternative text for the Banner's image.
  - **Custom**. Select Custom if you want to enter a custom code for
    your banner.
    - **Custom Code**. Use {CLICKURL} and {NAME} to merge 'Click URL'
      and 'Name' values respectively into your custom code. For example:
      `<a href="{CLICKURL}"><img src="enter url to image" alt="{NAME}" title="{NAME}"></a>`.  
      Another option is to enter an HTML custom code. For example:

is not pinned, the third Banner will not display if the Banner display
module setting is "Pinned, Randomise" or "Pinned, Ordering." Only the
two pinned Banners will display. If the pinned banners have a fixed
number of impressions, once those impressions are used up, the pinned
banners will no longer display, and the non-pinned banners will begin
displaying automatically.*

- **Language**. Item language.

<!-- -->

  in the item's [Version
  History](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Components_Version_History/en "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Components Version History/en")

width="800" height="907"
alt="Help-4x-Components-Banners-Banners-Edit-Publishing-Options-Tab-en.png" />

- **Start Publishing**. Date the Banner will publish and be available
  for website.

Enter the date (time optional) in format *year-month-date hrs:min:sec*
as '2013-01-07 14:10:00' or alternatively, use the modal 'pop up' window
and select a date from the calendar.

- **Finish Publishing**. Date the Banner will stop being published and
  will no longer be available for website.

Enter the date (time optional) in format *year-month-date hrs:min:sec*
as '2013-01-07 14:10:00' or alternatively, use the modal 'pop up' window
and select a date from the calendar.

- **Created Date**. Date the item(Article, Category, Weblink, etc.) was
  created.

<!-- -->

- **Created By**. Name of the Joomla User who created this item. This
  will default to the currently logged-in user. If you want to change
  this to a different user, click the Select User button to select a
  different user.

<!-- -->

  alias for this Author for this Article. This allows you to display a
  different Author name for this Article.

<!-- -->

- **Modified Date**. Date of last modification.

<!-- -->

- **Modified By**. Username who performed the last modification.

<!-- -->

- **Revision**. Number of revisions to this item.

- **Keywords**. Optional entry for keywords. Must be entered separated
  by commas (for example, "cats, dogs, pets") and may be entered in
  upper or lower case. (For example, "CATS" will match "cats" or
  "Cats"). Keywords can be used in several ways:
  1.  To help Search Engines and other systems classify the content of
      the Article.
  2.  In combination with Banner tags, to display specific Banners based
      on the Article content. For example, say you have one Banner with
      an ad for dog products and another Banner for cat products. You
      can have your dog Banner display when a User is viewing a
      dog-related Article and your cat Banner display for a cat-related
      Article. To do this, you would:
      - Add the keywords "dog" and "cat" to the appropriate Articles.
      - Add the Tags "dog" and "cat" to the appropriate Banners in
        [Banners:
        Edit](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Banners:_Edit/en "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Banners: Edit/en").
      - Set the Banner module Parameter 'Search By Tags' to "Yes" in
        [Site Modules:
        Banners](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Site_Modules:_Banners/en "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Site Modules: Banners/en").
  3.  For articles only, in combination with the ['Articles - Related'
      module](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Site_Modules:_Articles_-_Related/en "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Site Modules: Articles - Related/en"),
      to display Articles that share at least one keyword in common. For
      example, if the current Article displayed has the keywords "cats,
      dogs, monkeys", any other Articles with at least one of these
      keywords will show in the 'Articles - Related' module.

<!-- -->

- **Use Own Prefix.** Whether or not to use the banner's prefix or that
  of the client. Select *No* if you want to use the prefix of the banner
  client.

<!-- -->

- **Meta Keyword Prefix:** When matching meta keywords, only search for
  meta keywords with these optional prefixes. This improves performance.

## Toolbar

[Screenshot](#Screenshot) above. The functions are:

- **Save**. Saves the item and stays in the current screen.

<!-- -->

- **Save & Close**. Saves the item and closes the current screen.

  screen without saving any modifications you may have made. This

  versions of this item. This allows you to view older versions of this
  item and, if desired, restore from an older version. See [Version
  History](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Components_Version_History/en "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Components Version History/en")
  for more information.

## Quick Tips

- Banners are placed on specific pages by adding Modules of type
  'Banners' using the [Module
  Manager](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Modules/en "Help4.x:Modules/en").
- If you have a series of Banners that you would like to display on one
  or more pages in random order:
  1.  Create the Banners you wish to include, making sure they have the
      same Client and Category.
  2.  Create a Banner Module for this Client and Category, and in the
      Menu Assignment pick the Menu Selections for the module to display
      on.
  3.  In the Banner Module, set the 'Randomise' value to 'Sticky,
      Randomise'.

With these settings, the different Banners for that Client and Category
will display on the selected pages in random order.

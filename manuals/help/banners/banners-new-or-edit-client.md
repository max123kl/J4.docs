### Details Tab

- **Contact Name.** The name of the contact person for this client.

  indicate how the banner client purchased the display time for the

<!-- -->

  - *Published*: The item is published. This is the only state that will
    allow regular website users to view this item.
  - *Unpublished*: The item is unpublished.
  - *Archived*: The item has been archived.
  - *Trashed*: The item has been sent to the Trash.

- **Keywords**. Optional entry for keywords. Must be entered separated
  by commas (for example, "cats, dogs, pets") and may be entered in
  upper or lower case. (For example, "CATS" will match "cats" or
  "Cats"). Keywords can be used in several ways:
  1.  To help Search Engines and other systems classify the content of
      the Article.
  2.  In combination with Banner tags, to display specific Banners based
      on the Article content. For example, say you have one Banner with
      an ad for dog products and another Banner for cat products. You
      can have your dog Banner display when a User is viewing a
      dog-related Article and your cat Banner display for a cat-related
      Article. To do this, you would:
      - Add the keywords "dog" and "cat" to the appropriate Articles.
      - Add the Tags "dog" and "cat" to the appropriate Banners in
        [Banners:
        Edit](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Banners:_Edit/en "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Banners: Edit/en").
      - Set the Banner module Parameter 'Search By Tags' to "Yes" in
        [Site Modules:
        Banners](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Site_Modules:_Banners/en "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Site Modules: Banners/en").
  3.  For articles only, in combination with the ['Articles - Related'
      module](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Site_Modules:_Articles_-_Related/en "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Site Modules: Articles - Related/en"),
      to display Articles that share at least one keyword in common. For
      example, if the current Article displayed has the keywords "cats,
      dogs, monkeys", any other Articles with at least one of these
      keywords will show in the 'Articles - Related' module.

<!-- -->

- **Use Own Prefix.** Whether or not to use the banner's prefix or that
  of the client. Select *No* if you want to use the prefix of the banner
  client.

<!-- -->

- **Meta Keyword Prefix:** When matching meta keywords, only search for
  meta keywords with these optional prefixes. This improves performance.

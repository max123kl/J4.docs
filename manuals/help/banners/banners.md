## Description

Banners are blocks of content containing advertising information. Each
banner has a Client, the person paying for the information, and a Track
record, the number of times the banner has been selected. A site may
have several banners in different locations. The Banners screen shows a
list of existing Banners with links to edit current and create new
Banners. There must be at least one Banner Client and one Banner
Category **before** a Banner can be created.

## How to Access

- Select **Components **→** Banners **→** Banners** from the
  Administrator menu.
- Or Select a numbered button in the [Banner Categories
  Manager](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Banners:_Categories/en "Help4.x:Banners: Categories/en")
  or the [Banner Clients
  Manager](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Banners:_Clients/en "Help4.x:Banners: Clients/en")
  pages.

## Column Headers

In the table containing Banners the different columns are listed below.
Click on the column heading on the banner manager screen to sort the
list by that column's value.

- **Checkbox**. Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and
  Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only
  work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you
  press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.

<!-- -->

- **Ordering.** You can change the order of an item within a list as
  follows:
  - If the list Filter Options include a Position filter select the
    desired Position. This will limit the list to items that are
    assigned to that Position.
  - Select the Ordering icon <img

    decoding="async" data-file-width="12" data-file-height="23" width="12"
    height="23" alt="Help30-Ordering-colheader-icon.png" /> in the Table
    heading to make it the active ordering item. The ordering icons in
    each row will change from light grey to dark grey and the pointer
    will change to a drag arrow on hover.
  - Select one of the Ordering icons <img
    src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/8/87/Help30-Ordering-colheader-grab-bar-icon.png"
    decoding="async" data-file-width="10" data-file-height="21" width="10"
    height="21" alt="Help30-Ordering-colheader-grab-bar-icon.png" /> and
    drag it up or down to change the position of that row in the list.
    The items will display in the new order within the Position.

<!-- -->

- **Status**. The published status of the item.

<!-- -->

- **Name.** The name of the Banner. Editing Option - 'click' on the name
  to open the Banner for editing.

<!-- -->

- **Pinned**. *(Yes or No)* Whether or not the Banner is "pinned". If
  one or more Banners in a Category are designated "sticky," they will
  take priority over Banners that are not sticky.

*For example, if two Banners in a Category are pinned and a third Banner
is not pinned, the third Banner will not display if the Banner display
module setting is "Pinned, Randomise" or "Pinned, Ordering." Only the
two pinned Banners will display. If the pinned banners have a fixed
number of impressions, once those impressions are used up, the pinned
banners will no longer display, and the non-pinned banners will begin
displaying automatically.*

- **Client.** The Client for this Banner. Clients are entered using the
  Banner Client Manager.

<!-- -->

- **Impressions.** The Impression count is the number of times the
  Banner has been displayed on a page. The first number in this column
  is the actual number of Impressions so far, and the second number is
  how many Impressions were purchased by the client.

<!-- -->

- **Clicks.** The first number is the total number of clicks that have
  been made on the Banner since the counter was reset. The second number
  is what percentage of the time user clicked on the banner when it was
  displayed.

<!-- -->

- **Language**. Item language.

<!-- -->

- **ID**. This is a unique identification number for this item assigned
  automatically by Joomla. It is used to identify the item internally,
  and you cannot change this number. When creating a new item, this
  field displays "0" until you save the new entry, at which point a new
  ID is assigned to it.

## List Filters

**Search bar**. Near the top of the page you will see the search bar
shown in the [Screenshot](#screenshot) above.

- **Search by Text**. Enter part of the search term and click the Search
  icon. *Hover* to see a *Tooltip* indicating which fields will be
  searched.To 'Search by ID' enter "id:x", where "x" is the ID number
  (for example, "id:19").
- **Filter Options**. Click to display the additional filters.
- **Clear**. Click to clear the Filter field and restore the list to its
  unfiltered state.

    and descending order.

  from the dropdown list to change the number displayed.The default for

## Column Headers

Click on the title of a column header to sort by that column. The
purpose of each column is as follows:

- **Checkbox.** Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items.
- **Action.** The action performed by the user on your site (who did
  what)
- **Extensions.** The extension used to perform this action

  *Note: This column is displayed only when the option **IP logging** is
  set to **Yes** in the component options*
- **ID.** This is a unique identification number for this action
  assigned automatically by Joomla. It is used to identify the item
  internally, and you cannot change this number.

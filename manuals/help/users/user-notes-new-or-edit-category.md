Category.

## How to access

  menu. Then...

## Details

- **Title:** Title of the Category.
- **Alias:** The Alias will be used in the SEF URL. Leave this blank and
  Joomla will fill in a default value from the title. This value will
  depend on the SEO settings (**System **→** Global
  Configuration **→** Site**). Using Unicode will produce UTF-8 aliases.
  You may also enter manually any UTF-8 character. Spaces and some
  forbidden characters will be changed to hyphens.When using default
  transliteration it will produce an alias in lower case and with dashes
  instead of spaces. You may enter the Alias manually. Use lowercase
  letters and hyphens (-). No spaces or underscores are allowed. Default
  value will be a date and time if the title is typed in non-latin
  letters .

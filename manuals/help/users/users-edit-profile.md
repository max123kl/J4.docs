### W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) Login

This tab is only present when the site is accessed using https. To set
up passwordless login you need a hardware device, available from Amazon
and similar outlets for about £15, or a device with fingerprint or face
recognition or similar biometric software. You may add more than one
authenticator. Once set up, you can login by clicking the Web
Authentication button in the Login form and then pressing the button on
the device when prompted.

This tab is present but cannot be used in the User edit form because
passwordless login can only be set up by the individual user via the
Edit Profile form.

### Joomla API Token

This tab is used to manage the security tokens used for authenticating
to the Joomla API application (remote access to your site). If you are
not sure what this does chances are you don't need it and can safely
ignore these settings.

The token is only visible for your own account.

### Multi-factor Authentication

This tab allows you to set one or more methods to allow access to your
account after login with Username and Password. It is only present when
editing your own profile. There are several methods available. If you
lose access to one method for any reason you can choose another method
from the post-login verification screen. The alternative mthods must
have been set up in advance!

#### Backup Codes

This method generates a set of numbers that you can save or print. Each
number can be used only once, so remember to amend your list after use.

#### Verification code

An extra form to fill out with alternative methods of setting up the
code. Have a look and click the Cancel button if you decide not to
proceed.

#### Yubi Key

This is for another type of hardware key that provides a code on a
screen display. Have a look and select Cancel if you decide not to
proceed.

#### Web Authentication

For a hardware device with a button to press. Have a look and select
Cancel if you decide not to proceed. Note that this method will be
bypassed if you use the separate WebAuthn Login method.

#### Code by Email

With this method a code is sent to your email address. You will be
prompted to enter that code to gain site access. It is a one-time code.
A new one is sent for every login. Have a look and select Cancel if you
decide not to proceed.

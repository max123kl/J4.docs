## Description

objects a user can view. This screen allows you to create, view, edit,
and delete User Groups.

## How to access

## Column Headers

In the table containing the users from your Joomla! site, you will see
different columns. Here you can read what they mean and what is
displayed in that column.

- **Checkbox**. Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and
  Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only
  work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you
  press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.
- **Group Title**. The name of the group.
- **Permissions**. Link to The Advanced Permissions Report which maps
  out the exact permissions for any given user group across all assets
  on your Joomla! installation.
- **Enabled users**. (Tick) The number of enabled users in this group.
- **Disabled users**. (X) The number of disabled users in this group.

<!-- -->

- **ID**. This is a unique identification number for this item assigned
  automatically by Joomla. It is used to identify the item internally,
  and you cannot change this number. When creating a new item, this
  field displays "0" until you save the new entry, at which point a new
  ID is assigned to it.

## List Filters

At the top you will see the search bar shown in the Screenshot above.
The functions are:

- **Search**. Filter by Partial Group Name or Group ID. Enter part of
  the group's name and press the Search icon to find matching names.
  Press Clear to clear the search field and restore the list of groups.

## Toolbar

At the top you will see the toolbar shown in the Screenshot above. The
functions are:

- **New**. Opens the editing screen to create a new user group.

<!-- -->

- **Delete:** Deletes the selected user groups. Works with one or
  multiple user groups selected. If you delete a group that has users
  assigned to it, those users will lose the permissions they had from
  that group. It is recommended to remove all users from a group before
  you delete the group.

<!-- -->

- **Options.** Opens the Options window where settings such as default
  parameters can be edited.

<!-- -->

- **Help**. Opens this help screen.

## Quick Tips

- Click on the name of a group to edit the group's properties.

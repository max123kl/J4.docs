## Column Headers

In the table containing the user notes assigned to users registered on
your Joomla! site, you will see different columns. Here you can read
what they mean and what is displayed in that column.

- **Checkbox**. Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and
  Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only
  work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you
  press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.
- **Status**. (Published/Unpublished/Archived/Trashed) The published
  status of the item.
- **Subject**. The subject of the user note.
- **User**. The name of the user.
- **Review date**. The date when the user note was created.

<!-- -->

- **ID**. This is a unique identification number for this item assigned
  automatically by Joomla. It is used to identify the item internally,
  and you cannot change this number. When creating a new item, this
  field displays "0" until you save the new entry, at which point a new
  ID is assigned to it.

## List Filters

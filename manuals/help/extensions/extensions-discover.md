## Description

This screen allows you to discover extensions that have not gone through
the normal installation process. This provides a method to install large
extensions which are not possible to install using the normal process.
For example, some extensions are too large in file size to upload using
the web interface due to limitations of the web hosting environment.
Using this feature you can upload extension files directly to your web
server using some other means such as FTP or SFTP and place those
extension files into the appropriate directory. You can then use the
discover feature to find the newly uploaded extension and activate it in
your Joomla! installation. Using the discover operation you can also
discover and install multiple extensions at the same time. An extension
can be installed with the discover function by doing the following
steps:

1.  Upload the uncompressed extension files to the appropriate directory
    in your Joomla! installation. For example, if you wanted to upload a
    site template extension to your Joomla! installation you would
    create a directory for the template extension in the /templates
    sub-directory of your Joomla! installation. Then you would upload
    the template extension files into that directory you created.
2.  After you have uploaded the extension files, go back to the
    Extension Manager Discover screen and click the **Discover** button
    in the toolbar. This will initiate the search function which will
    search your Joomla! extension directories looking for uninstalled
    extensions.
3.  If the extension you uploaded is compatible with Joomla! version and
    is not already installed, it will appear in the listing of
    discovered extensions in this screen.
4.  Click the check-box to the left of the discovered extension and then
    click the **Install** button in the toolbar. This will install the
    extension into your Joomla! installation.

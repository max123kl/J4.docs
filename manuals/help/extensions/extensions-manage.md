## Quick Tips

- Throughout the administrator interface of Joomla! you will see the
  terms "Publish" and "Unpublish". *Publish* means the same thing as
  *Enable* or *Activate*. *Unpublish* means the same thing as *Disable*
  or *Deactivate*. You may see the terms used interchangeably in
  extension screens and help documentation you find online.
- Some information such as *Date* or *Author* may not be displayed for
  an extension. This is not a problem. It merely means the information
  was not specified by the extension developer in the extension's
  installation package.

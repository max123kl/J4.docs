## Quick Tips

- Important: Do not delete the default template files using FTP because
  it generates an error in both the front-end and back-end.
- Before editing the HTML and the CSS file of the template, it is a good
  idea to make a backup of the file you are editing. Also, you can edit
  these files outside of Joomla! using the HTML or CSS editor of your
  choice.
